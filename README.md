#Introduction

This report focuses specifically on sentiment elicitation from
Amazon food reviews, examining customer feedback to understand
sentiment distribution, review engagement, and user behaviors.
Through detailed exploratory data analysis, we identify key char-
acteristics of Amazon reviews, such as a significant skew toward
positive sentiments, polarized helpfulness ratings, and trends indi-
cating increased user participation over time.

To quantify and categorize sentiments, we implemented three
machine learning models. Transformer-based models (RoBERTa and
DistilBERT) were selected due to their advanced contextual under-
standing capabilities, while a CNN model with GloVe embeddings
was chosen for its computational efficiency and straightforward
interpretability. Our findings not only contribute to existing litera-
ture but also highlight critical methodological gaps, particularly the
treatment of neutral sentiments and handling of class imbalance.
